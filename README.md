 # Steps
   1) Firstly you need the CNN model that I trained during my time of building this project.
   2) Create a folder named model (CASE SENSITIVE) and store the downloaded model in the folder.
   3) Create another folder named colorized_videos  (CASE SENSITIVE) to store the final colorized video.
   now run the ipnb files cell by cell if you have all the required libraries installed than project should work fine.
